# Mom's Music

- Kinda Music Player

## Motivation

- This small project took root as an inspiration drawn from my mom's endearing daily morning routine of immersing herself in devotional songs. With the desire to create something unique and meaningful, I endeavored to fashion a simple music player that has now blossomed into the tiny app you see before you.
